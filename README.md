# CodeClause Data Science Intern Project-1: Gold Price Prediction

This repository contains the code and resources for the Gold Price Prediction project, which is part of the CodeClause Data Science Internship program.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the price of gold based on historical data. The project involves the following steps:

1. Data collection: Gather historical gold price data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/gold-price-data?resource=download).
2. Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data to make it suitable for model training.
3. Model selection: Explore different machine learning algorithms and select the most suitable one for gold price prediction.
4. Model training: Train the selected model using the preprocessed data.
5. Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `gold.csv/`: This directory contains the raw and preprocessed data used in the project.
- `Gold_Price_Prediction.ipynb/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebook used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.


## Installation and Usage

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository 
2. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing the dependencies.
3. Execute the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory in the specified order.
4. Train and evaluate the machine learning models using the provided scripts or Jupyter notebooks.
